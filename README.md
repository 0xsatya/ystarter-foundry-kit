# Yearn Starter Kit

**All code in this repository is meant for instructional purposes only is not audited or considered safe for production.**

## What you'll find here

- Basic example Solidity Smart Contracts for integrating with Yearn Vaults.

- ERC4626 adapter to wrap yearn vaults.

- Sample test suite. ([`tests`](src/test/))


## Installation and Setup

1. To install with [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry).

2. Fork this repository.

3. Clone your newly created repository recursively to include modules.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/storming0x/ystarter-foundry-kit.git

cd ystarter-foundry-kit
```

NOTE: if you create from template you may need to run the following command to fetch the git submodules (.gitmodules for exact releases) `git submodule init && git submodule update`

4. Build the project.

```sh
make build
```

5. Sign up for [Infura](https://infura.io/) and generate an API key and copy your RPC url. Store it in the `ETH_RPC_URL` environment variable.
NOTE: you can use other services.

6. Use .env file
  1. Make a copy of `.env.example`
  2. Add the values for `ETH_RPC_URL`, `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`Â and other example vars
     NOTE: If you set up a global environment variable, that will take precedence.

7. Run tests
```sh
make test
```

## Basic Use

To deploy the demo Yearn Vaults and ERC4626 adapter in a development environment:

TODO

## Testing

Tests run in fork environment, you need to complete [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) step 6 to be able to run these commands.

```sh
make test
```
Run tests with traces (very useful)

```sh
make trace
```
Run specific test contract (e.g. `test/MyTest.t.sol`)

```sh
make test-contract contract=MyTest
```
Run specific test contract with traces (e.g. `test/MyTest.t.sol`)

```sh
make trace-contract contract=MyTest
```
